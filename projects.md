## The Qubinode
Our project aims to make it easy for anyone to set up an OpenShift cluster. Red Hat has a ton of solutions for OpenShift in the cloud, but on-prem requires expensive hardware, proprietary software licensing, subscriptions, some consulting time and expertise to set things up given the complexity of the technology. This creates a barrier to entry for most people who are curious and/or wanting to explore at home or in the lab. To solve this problem, we developed the Qubinode. It is an easy to set up development kit powered by Red Hat products.<br>
__Needed:__ Setting up a testing infrastructure. Creating a CI/CD pipeline, where we can consistently run the qubinode-installer to deploy the supported products.<br>
